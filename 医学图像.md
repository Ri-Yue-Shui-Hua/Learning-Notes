## Annotation

Segmentation was done first with an interactive software (Mialab), followed by manual inspection and correction using ITKSNAP. The interactive method is based on fuzzy connectedness followed by level set method. Both the segmentation mask and annotated anatomical landmarks were created by a trained radiologist.

## File formats

DICOM. Please see our help pages for some examples of [working with DICOM](https://datahub.aida.scilifelab.se/about/help/#working-with-dicom).

### Importing binary masks to numpy

The dataset contains a DICOM SEG file, which can be converted to an ITK image file (mha, nifti, etc) by using [dcmqi](https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi) and the command line tool [segimage2itkimage](https://qiicr.gitbook.io/dcmqi-guide/opening/cmd_tools/seg/segimage2itkimage), which is straightforward to read into a numpy array.

### Landmarks

Landmarks are available in the sr.dcm file and saved using the TID 1500 template.
